# TDS -  Thermal desorption spectroscopy


# Purpose of this project  - Making sense of TDS spectra
vacancy effects induced by H induced strain are being studied here for bulk Ni.
Fig 1 plots Hydrogen escaping the system versus the temperature.
Fig 2 analyses the rate of hydrogen escaping the system with increasing temperature.
